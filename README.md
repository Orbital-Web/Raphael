# Raphael
A (soon to be) custom chess engine, coded in C++, made using the Negamax algorithm, a variant of the Minimax algorithm.
Will probably start work on it around September 2023. The engine will be based on a previous engine I built in Python, with a few optimization and improvement ideas in mind.


## Getting started
*Compile main.exe:* `g++ -o main main.cpp src/GameEngine/thc.cpp`
