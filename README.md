# Raphael
Both a UCI Chess Engine (Raphael) and a Chess GUI (to play against Raphael or to make Raphael play itself), coded in C++, using [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) and [Disservin's Chess Library](https://github.com/Disservin/chess-library).

Raphael is still a work in progress and will be updated as time goes by (though it's already quite competent). [Scroll to the bottom](https://github.com/Orbital-Web/Raphael#raphael-engine) to see a list of features currently implemented.

Raphael is largely inspired by [Sebastian Lague's Coding Adventure series on implementing a Chess Engine](https://youtu.be/U4ogK0MIzqk), and is a revisit/successor to a previous engine I coded in Python. 

*Note: v1.6 will be the last of the minor releases to Raphael. The next major release will be v2.0 using a custom NNUE evaluation function.*

</p>



## Getting started (Windows)
1. Clone the repository (*make sure to use `--recurse-submodules` when pulling too*)
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Orbital-Web/Raphael.git --recurse-submodules
    ```
2. Download [SFML-2.6.0 (GCC MinGW Version)](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.6.0/) and add it to the root directory
3. Copy `openal32.dll` from `SFML-2.6.0/bin/` and add it to the root directory
4. Compile and run `main.exe` with the following commands (optionally, compile with the `-DMUTEEVAL` flag to mute evaluations)
    ```
    g++ -c main.cpp -Isrc -Ichess-library/src -ISFML-2.6.0/include -DSFML_STATIC
    g++ -o main main.o -LSFML-2.6.0/lib -lsfml-graphics-s -lsfml-window-s -lsfml-audio-s -lsfml-system-s -lopengl32 -lfreetype -lwinmm -lgdi32 -lopenal32 -lflac -lvorbisenc -lvorbisfile -lvorbis -logg
    del main.o
    main.exe human "Human" Raphael "Raphael" -s "game.pgn"
    ```
5. Try out other features (check out `main.exe -help`)

The compilation process should be similar for Linux and macOS, though setting up SFML may be slightly different. Please refer to the [official SFML documentation](https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.6/).

To compile and run the uci engine, follow steps 1~2 and use the commands (consider also increasing the `TABLE_SIZE` to `2^24`)
```
g++ -c uci.cpp -Isrc -Ichess-library/src -ISFML-2.6.0/include -DSFML_STATIC
g++ -o uci uci.o -LSFML-2.6.0/lib -lsfml-graphics-s
del uci.o
uci.exe
```



## Features
### Game Engine (GUI)
The game engine is a combination of `GameEngine.hpp`, `GamePlayer.hpp`, and `HumanPlayer.hpp`. It is a GUI-based chess game engine (not to be confused with a chess engine) which lets the user interactively play chess. 

If using a human player, the user may annotate the board with arrows and select/play moves similarly to other chess GUIs. The user may also specify the number of rounds, different time controls, starting positions (with fens), and even swap out the players (e.g., with different versions of Raphael). 

To use it, refer to the [setup instructions above](https://github.com/Orbital-Web/Raphael#getting-started-windows), and run the command `main.exe -help` in the command line. 


### Raphael (Engine)
Raphael is a UCI-compliant chess engine that comes with this project. To use it in other UCI-compliant softwares, compile `uci.cpp` using the [instructions above](https://github.com/Orbital-Web/Raphael#getting-started-windows). The UCI engine currently supports the following commands: `uci`, `ready`, `ucinewgame`, `position`, and `go`. Pondering is not implemented yet. The engine contains the following features:

## ELO (CEGT) and Comparisons

Different versions of the engine were put against each other in 400 matches (20 seconds each), starting from a different  position (within a ±300 centipawn stockfish evaluation) and alternating between playing as white and black.

To estimate Raphael's [ELO](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Match_Statistics#Elo-Rating_.26_Win-Probability), I paired Raphaelv1.6 (the newest version at the time of testing) against [Shallow Blue](https://github.com/GunshipPenguin/shallow-blue) (a C++ chess engine written by Rhys Rustad-Elliott) inside of [Arena](http://www.playwitharena.de) in a 10 rounds gauntlet tournament with random starting positions. 

The results came out as 6 wins, 4 losses, and 0 draws, putting Raphaelv1.6 at a CEGT ELO of around 1550 (though I believe Shallow Blue performs better in longer time controls and worse on lower time controls than Raphaelv1.6). 

From that, I estimated the ELOs of the other versions using the approxiamte relationship between [win probability and ELO differnece](https://www.chessprogramming.org/Match_Statistics#Elo-Rating_.26_Win-Probability).

Note that this method of ELO estimation is very crude, with only 10 rounds against one other engine. In the future, I will conduct a more thorough comparison (maybe once v2.0 is out).
